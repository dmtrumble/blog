title: A new website for architects - Books on Buildings!
---

## Architects don't actually read, they just flip through the pictures. For architects and more, there's [Books on Buildings!][1]


I made Books on Buildings to gather high quality architectural resources together in one location with a simple interface. It’s for anyone interested in learning about architecture, particularly those who lack access to institutional quality architectural libraries.

Books on Buildings doesn't present new content; all materials were previously available from the many good institutions engaged in the cost-and-labor-intensive process of digitizing their collections. But visiting even a handful of sites to find a resource is cumbersome, and the proprietary interfaces of each application creates a fragmented experience. Also, a subject-specific collection makes discovering relevant material easier. The [Books on Buildings][1] catalog was gathered from the following digital libraries:
	
* [Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg][2]
* [Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art][3]
* [Bibliothèque nationale de France][4]
* [Elektronische Bibliothek Schweiz][5]
* [University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute][6]
* [The Internet Archive][7]  (also an aggregator, with contributing institutions including The Smithsonian Libraries and the Getty Research Institute)
* [Hesburgh Libraries - University of Notre Dame][8]

The book was the medium through which architectural knowledge was liberated from the guild halls of tradesmen to become a publicly accessible liberal art. Putting those books online continues this process by further democratizing access. The goal of [Books on Buildings][1] is to increase knowledge and understanding of architecture, and to highlight the important function of digital libraries. Thanks for visiting.
