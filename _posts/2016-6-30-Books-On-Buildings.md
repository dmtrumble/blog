## Architects don't actually read books, they just look at the pictures. But they sure can write!


[Books on Buildings][1] is a simple website for discovering and viewing architectural books. It pulls content from the following sites:


* [Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg][2]
* [Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art][3]
* [Bibliothèque nationale de France][4]
* [Elektronische Bibliothek Schweiz][5]
* [University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute][6]
* [The Internet Archive][7]
* [Hesburgh Libraries - University of Notre Dame][8]


It's for anyone interested in the theory, practice, or history of architecture, who may or may not access to a good (phycial) library. Find it here: [Books on Buildings][1] Thanks for visiting!
