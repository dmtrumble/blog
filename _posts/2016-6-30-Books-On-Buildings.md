## Architects don't actually read books, they just look at the pictures. But they write a lot!


If you don't have a huge architecture library to call your own, these digital versions have almost everything:


* [Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg][2]
* [Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art][3]
* [Bibliothèque nationale de France][4]
* [Elektronische Bibliothek Schweiz][5]
* [University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute][6]
* [The Internet Archive][7]
* [Hesburgh Libraries - University of Notre Dame][8]


[Books on Buildings][1] pulls the architectural books from these and others into one place, with a simpler interface. 

Find it here: [Books on Buildings][1] Thanks for visiting!
