title: Books on Buildings, a new website for architects
excerpt: For discovering and viewing architectural books
---

## Architects don't actually read books, they just look at the pictures. They write a lot, though!

A good architectural library is the foundation of any informed architectural practice. Books, more so than buildings, are the primary medium for the transmission of architectural knowledge. From Vitruvius to Le Corbusier, Architects have produced books to promote their practice, influence the practice of other architects, and record built works of the past.

Naturally, access to this knowledge is fundamental to the practice of architecture. Digital libraries serve to democratize this access. For younger and less fortunate practitioners, a digital architectural library can provide exposure to the entire history of architectural discourse without the budgetary or logistic requirements of maintaining a physical library.

Through the various institutions listed below, many of the most important historical works of architectural scholarship have been digitized and published online.

I made **[Books on Buildings][1]** to defragment the process of accessing these works. It pulls together content from the following websites into a quick and simple interface:

* [Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg][2]  
* [Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art][3]
* [Bibliothèque nationale de France][4]
* [Elektronische Bibliothek Schweiz][5]
* [University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute][6]
* [The Internet Archive][7]
* [Hesburgh Libraries - University of Notre Dame][8]
