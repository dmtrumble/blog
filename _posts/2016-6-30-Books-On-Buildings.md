title: Books on Buildings, a new website for architects
excerpt: For discovering and viewing architectural books
---

## Architects don't actually read books, they just look at the pictures. They write a lot, though!

Any good architectural project probably began, in one way or another, in a good architectural library.  Even more so than buildings, the architectural treatise is the fundamental mode of transmission for architectural knowledge. From Vitruvius to Le Corbusier, Architects have produced books to promote their practice, influence the practice of other architects, and record built works of the past.


Naturally, having access to this knowledge is integral the vitality of an architectural practice. Digital libraries have the ability to democratize this access. Particularly valuable for students and younger designers,  a digital architectural library can provide exposure to the entire history of architectural thought without the budgetary or logistic requirements of maintaining a physical library. 


Through the various institutions listed below, many of the most important historical works of architectural scholarship have been digitized and published online. But the lack of a centralized location for strictly architectural works made finding a specific resource prohibitively time consuming.


**[Books on Buildings][1]** is a tool I built to defragment the process of accessing these works. It pulls content from the following websites into a simple and easy interface:


* [Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg][2]  
* [Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art][3]
* [Bibliothèque nationale de France][4]
* [Elektronische Bibliothek Schweiz][5]
* [University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute][6]
* [The Internet Archive][7]
* [Hesburgh Libraries - University of Notre Dame][8]
