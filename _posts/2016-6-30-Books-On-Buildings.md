title: A new website for architects - Books on Buildings!
excerpt: It's well known that architects don't actually read books, they just flip through the pictures. But they sure write a lot! See for yourself at Books on Buildings.

## Architects don't read books of course, they just look at the pictures. But they write a lot!


If you don't have a huge architecture library to call your own, these digital libraries have almost everything:


* [Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg][2]
* [Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art][3]
* [Bibliothèque nationale de France][4]
* [Elektronische Bibliothek Schweiz][5]
* [University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute][6]
* [The Internet Archive][7]  (contributing institutions include The Smithsonian Libraries and the Getty Research Institute)
* [Hesburgh Libraries - University of Notre Dame][8]


[Books on Buildings][1] pulls the architectural books from these sites and others into one place, with a simpler interface. 

Find it here: [Books on Buildings][1] Thanks for visiting!
