title: A proposal for the Rieger Graham Prize
excerpt: My unsuccessful application to study classical housing projects in Rome
---

## I applied for a fellowship in Rome sponsored by the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art (ICAA). The application required a written proposal for a project involving research, documentation and design. Here's mine.


The unification of Italy in 1870 triggered a sharp increase Rome’s population as workers, professionals, and bureaucrats began migrating to the new capital in search of opportunity.<sup id="f1">[1](#fn1)</sup> The lack of existing infrastructure and inability of the nascent private sector to meet the demand for housing led to the creation of a groundbreaking new building type: the public housing development.


The Italian Government created the Instituto Case Popolari (ICP) in 1903 to construct subsidized housing for lower and working class Romans. The ICP planned and built the first state run housing developments in Europe.<sup id="f1">[2](#fn1)</sup>  Tasked with providing low cost but high quality housing, the ICP relied on the classical principles of design that had produced the remarkable city in which they worked.  My study will demonstrate the classical origins of the social housing typology and the influence of historic Roman architecture on the planning, materials, and decorative programs of the ICP’s biggest projects. I will investigate how these underappreciated masterpieces, in the context of one of the most progressive periods in the history of classical architecture, repurposed older solutions to address new problems. Finally, I will show the continued applicability of those solutions today.


I will focus on six major projects completed during the tenure of lead ICP designer Innocenzo Sabbatini, from 1925 to 1931 <sup id="f1">[2](#fn1)</sup> :


| Name | Year | Neighborhood | Location, Main Buildings, etc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quarter Piazza d’Armi II & III | 1925-1926 | Quartiere Vittoria (Q. XV) | Group II: Lots 44a & 44b (2 blocks, Via Sabotino & V. Monte Santo); Group III (½  block, Via Pietro Borsieri) |
| Quarter Città Giardino Aniene VII | 1922-1925 | Quartiere Monte Sacro (Q. XVI) |Lot 1, (2 blocks, Piazza Sempione) |
| Garbatella III & VI | 1920-1930 | Quartiere Ostiense (Q. X) | Group III: Teatro Palladium & Public Baths (Piazza Bartolomeo Romano); Group VI: Lots 41, 42, 43, 44 (4 Blocks, incl. Albergo Rosso, Albergo Bianco, Piazza Michele da Carbonara) |
| Trionfale III, IV, V | 1925-1930 | Quartiere Trionfale (Q. XIV) | Trionfale III: Lots 3, 4, 6 (2 Blocks, Circonvallazione Trionfale); Trionfale IV: Lots 1 & 3 (1-½ Blocks, Circonvallazione Clodia); Trionfale V: Lot 1 (1/2 block, Via Vittorio Arminjon) |
| Testaccio IV | 1929 | Rione Testaccio (R. XX) Lots 26 & 27 (2 Blocks, Via Marmorata) |
| St. Ippolito II | 1930 | Quartiere Tiburtino (Q. VI) | La Casa del sole (1 block, Via della Lega Lombarda) |



I will use field sketches, measured drawings, and historical research to investigate how Sabbatini used classical precedents, local materials, and traditional urbanism to create dignified and economical housing in Rome just as it was transforming into a 20th century city.


The complex programmatic demands of social housing - including residential units, support services, and public areas - necessitated large structures with floor plates of many thousands of square feet. I will document the traditional planning methods that Sabbatini used to maintain the scale and character of the surrounding historic neighborhoods. One such tactic was the modulation of street facing walls to form small piazze along the street. In the example of Albergo Rosso, a homeless shelter in Garbatella, an undulating wall reminiscent of a Baroque chapel is used to form an elegant gathering space for the neighborhood:

Public bathing facilities were a feature in most ICP developments, which required suitable lighting and ventilation to maintain proper hygiene. For the baths on the top floor in this mixed use building in Garbatella, Sabbatini used large semicircular windows to provide both, an idea he must have borrowed from the Imperial Baths of Diocletian:


![Piazza Bartolomeo Romano][img-2]


This building also features vaulted balconies to provide the 2nd floor residential units with outdoor living space - a requirement imposed by the Roman climate. The ancients employed this same strategy for the insulae at Ostia in the 2nd century AD.


One lesson that Rome teaches us is that everything new is simply a reworking of something older, or often, a combination of many older things. Sabbatini engaged in this tradition to solve new and complex issues of the early 20th century. I hope to show how the history of the modern public housing development is intertwined with, and therefore indicative of, the history of Rome itself.


I will extend the above research to examine the suitability of Sabbatini's work to inform contemporary architecture in the context of today’s moat pressing issues. Although the appetite for new public housing has waned in recent years due the current political/financial climate, rapid urban population growth has combined with rising income inequality to generate significant shortages of affordable housing in cities worldwide. For instance, 200,000 affordable housing units are needed in New York City alone.<sup id="f1">[3](#fn1)</sup> Moreover, global climate change will force architects to consider more economical and resource conscious means of construction and planning. The work of Sabbatini offers proven classical solutions to these issues therefore merit further attention by architectural community.


To apply my research in a design exercise, I will produce an original design for a new public housing project in the ICAA’s hometown of New York City. The site will be 9-block plot in the Lower East Side known as the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area (SPURA).  The area was once the home to nearly 2000 working class immigrant families before being razed in 1967 as part of a slum-clearing ‘urban renewal’ plan. The city recently leased the SPURA land to a partnership of speculative real estate developers who’ve produced plans for a 1.9 million square feet mixed use complex of modernist high-rises.<sup id="f1">[4](#fn1)</sup> Only a fraction of the new residential units will be affordable to working class families. My counter proposal will demonstrate an alternate approach to urban housing development that is based on a modernized version of Sabbatini’s model. The massing will be articulated to maintain the scale and urban character of the historic neighborhood. Additionally, the decorative program will be based on the character and materials of the Lower East Side and East Village.  The program will include communal living and recreation spaces, internal courtyards, movie theater, farmer’s market, pre-k/child care facilities, and emergency homeless accommodations. This project will prove the continued relevance of classical ideas, and will generate public interest in a classical alternative to new development in the city.
