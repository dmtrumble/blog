title: Auguste Perret on truth, beauty, and Nature in architecture.
excerpt: A new translation of Perret's "Contribution à une théorie de l'architecture"
---

## He who conceals a column commits a fault. He who makes a false column commits a crime.



With advances in the field of material sciences providing today's architect a continuous supply of new products, Perret is a relevant model for contemporary study. Thus the relative scarcity of English translations of his written work is surprising.

In 1947, the Swiss art journal <a href="http://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/volumes?UID=wbw-002">Das Werk</a> published Perret's essay “Contribution à une théorie de l'architecture”. Part architectural treatise, part poetry, it contains important insights into Perret’s design philosophy. He discusses the relationship between technology and architecture, the inseparability of space and materiality, and what constitutes real beauty. <a href="http://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?var=true&pid=wbw-002:1947:34::1089#119">French speakers can enjoy the original version from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Digital Library</a>. I hired a french Craigslister to help me produce the English translation below:

<div style="margin-left:10%;margin-top:2.5em;">
<p style="font-family:montserrat; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:0px;"> TECHNOLOGY </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">eternal homage to nature,<br />
sustenance for the imagination,<br />
real source of inspiration,<br />
the most powerful prayer,<br />
the mother tongue of any creator,<br />
technology, in the hands of a poet, leads to:</p>
<p style="font-family:montserrat; font-weight:bold;"> ARCHITECTURE </p>

<p>Architecture is the art of organizing space.<br />
It’s through construction that it expresses itself.</p>

<p>Moving or stationary<br />
Everything that occupies space<br />
belongs to Architecture.</p>

<p>Architecture seizes space,<br />
restricts, encloses, and confines it.<br />
Its privilege is to conjure magical places,<br />
created entirely by the mind.</p></div>

<div style="margin-left:10%;">
<p>Architecture is, of all artistic expressions,<br />
the one most subject to material conditions.</p>

<p>Permanent are the conditions imposed by Nature.<br />
Temporary are those imposed by Man.</p>

<p>Climate, its fluctuations,<br />
materials, their properties,<br />
physics, its laws,<br />
perspective, its distortions;<br />
The eternal and universal significance<br />
of the lines and shapes,<br />
impose permanent conditions.</p>

<p>Function, purpose, regulations, fashion,<br />
impose temporary conditions.</p>

<p>The architect is a builder<br />
who satisfies the temporary through the permanent.<br />
He is the one who,<br />
through a graceful combination of science and intuition,<br />
designs a ship, a portico, a royal palace<br />
capable of accommodating, as a whole,<br />
the variety of elements necessary for its function.</p>

<p>In the act of building the architect satisfies<br />
both permanent and temporary conditions.</p></div>

<div style="margin-left:10%;">
<p>Construction is the mother tongue<br />
of the architect.<br />
The architect is a poet who thinks and speaks<br />
in construction.</p>

<p>The great buildings of today incorporate frameworks,<br />
structures of steel or reinforced concrete.</p>

<p>The frame is to a building what the skeleton is to an animal.</p>

<p>Just like the skeleton of the animal,<br />
rhythmic, balanced, symmetrical,<br />
contains and supports the diverse organs<br />
in their various locations,<br />
the building’s structure<br />
must likewise be composed, rhythmic, balanced, symmetrical.</p>

<p>It must contain the diverse elements and services<br />
in their various locations,<br />
required by its purpose, its function.</p>

<p>He who conceals any part of the structure<br />
deprives the only legitimate, and most beautiful, ornament of architecture.<br />
He who conceals a column commits a fault.<br />
He who makes a false column commits a crime.</p>

<p>A building is a structure with elements<br />
and forms imposed by the permanent conditions,<br />
thereby subject to Nature,<br />
which links it to the past and makes it timeless.</p></div>

<img src="http://dtlib.github.io/blog/images/perret/image3.png" alt="Perret buildings">

<div style="margin-left:10%;">
<p>With the temporary and<br />
permanent conditions satisfied,<br />
the building - thus subject to Man and Nature -<br />
gains character; it exhibits style and harmony.<br />
Character, style, and harmony line the road that,<br />
through truth, leads to beauty.</p>

<p>It is through the splendor of truth<br />
that a building achieves beauty.

<p>The truth<br />
is in everything honored and burdened<br />
with the task of bearing and protecting.</p>

<p>This truth is the part<br />
that will make it shine,<br />
and the part that<br />
makes a man himself.</p>
