## I work for seven hours a day, so I can then drink for two -France Prešeren

One of Jože Plečnik's best but least known designs is this mausoleum for the poet France Prešeren, at Vrba, Slovenia. Designed in 1949, probably for the centennial anniversary of Prešeren’s death, it was never built. I made a digital model from the surviving drawings to help visualize what could have been.
